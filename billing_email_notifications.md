# Enabiling Email Notifications

E-mail notifications are set to "No" by default. This default setting is to prevent unwanted email notifications. Therefore, each user must turn on email notifications by accessing the M-RETS platform.Â 

## 1. Select Organization Info in the drop-down in the upper right corner:

INSERT EMAIL NOTIFICATION 1 SCREENSHOT 

<br>

## 2. Select "Users" 

INSERT EMAIL 2 SCREENSHOT 



<br>

## 3. Locate the User you would like to update notification preferences and select "Edit User" from the right of the table.

INSERT EMAIL 3 SCREENSHOT 

<br>

## 4. Scroll down and locate the Notifications Module

INSERT EMAIL 4 SCREENSHOT 

### Select your notification preferences. You will receive emails even if another user triggers a transaction. For example, if another user submits a transfer, you will receive an email if your "Transfer" notifications are set to On.

<br>

## 5. Select "Save".
