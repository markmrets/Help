# Enrolling in Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Please reference the below help article for how to enroll in MFA. 

M-RETS has made changes to our MFA sign-in options, Authy has discounted the use of the app, and users who have MFA enabled must now request their code via SMS or Voice call. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) works by combining "something you know" (i.e., your credentials) with "something you have" (i.e., a time-based one-time password retrieved via a trusted mobile device) to gain access to a system. 

Multi-factor authentication has rapidly become a security best practice, and we want to encourage all organizations and users to consider opting in. MFA protects against the risks associated with compromised passwords by adding a layer of security to system authentication. The reality is that employees do fall for phishing scams, and they do share passwords. If you're not using multi-factor authentication (MFA), your organization is open to attacks. A vast, if not one of the biggest, security threat today is the risk of compromised credentials.
