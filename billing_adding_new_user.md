# Adding a New User to an Organization


This article will walk through how to add a user to an organization.

M-RETS does not allow the sharing of user accounts. ***M-RETS requires every person that logs into the system to have their own separate user login credentials.*** M-RETS tracks the specific activities of each user through the unique user ID and password. An organization can have an unlimited number of users added to its organization.
